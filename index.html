          data-detailed-text="Generally considered dogkind's finest all-purpose worker, the German Shepherd Dog is a large, agile, muscular dog of noble character and high intelligence. Loyal, confident, courageous, and steady, the German Shepherd is truly a dog lover's delight. German Shepherd Dogs can stand as high as 26 inches at the shoulder and, when viewed in outline, presents a picture of smooth, graceful curves rather than angles. The natural gait is a free-and-easy trot, but they can turn it up a notch or two and reach great speeds. There are many reasons why German Shepherds stand in the front rank of canine royalty, but experts say their defining attribute is character: loyalty, courage, confidence, the ability to learn commands for many tasks, and the willingness to put their life on the line in defense of loved ones. German Shepherds will be gentle family pets and steadfast guardians, but, the breed standard says, there's a 'certain aloofness that does not lend itself to immediate and indiscriminate friendships.'">grisha

          data-detailed-text="Dogs have the emotional capacity of a 2- to 2.5-year-old child, so they can experience emotions like joy, fear, and anger. But, like many toddlers, your dog lacks the vocabulary to tell you how they feel, so it’s up to you to learn how your dog expresses emotions.
                                                
                                                        For example, most of us know what it looks like when our dog is frustrated or wants something. Your dog may bark, hop up and down, stare intently at whatever they want, whine, tremble, or show some other sign.
                                                
                                                        Dogs can also show love, affection, playfulness, and happiness through their body language and behaviors. You may be familiar with the signs that your dog is happy in the moment—soft, relaxed ears and eyes, a wagging tail, puppy kisses, and a broad smile. However, dogs are individuals, and their activity levels and desire to be social vary as they grow and age.

The Pug has a short muzzle and a tightly curled tail. It is a squarely built muscular dog with a large head, prominent dark eyes, and small drooping ears. At maturity it stands 10 to 13 inches (25.5 to 33 cm) tall at the withers and weighs about 14 to 18 pounds (6 to 8 kg). Its coat is short and glossy; colour is given in the breed standard as black or as silver or apricot fawn with a black line on the back and a black mask on the face. Typically loyal and alert, the Pug is a valued companion dog.">vasya
